This is a calculator for a Dungeons & Dragons character that I used to play as: known as Erick

My game master allowed me to bend the rules of the game a little bit, and jump crazy long distance

With some additional manipulation of the game's mechanics, I had a lot of things I needed to keep track of when playing as Erick in combat

This calculator enabled me to simplify this process by keeping track of information such as:
- Spells
- Movement
- Actions in combat
- Turn count
- Other abilities Erick has
